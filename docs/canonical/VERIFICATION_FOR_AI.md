## 1) Invariants (must always hold)

### 1.1 Closed-candle only
- All computations use only candles with `closeTime <= asof_ts_ms`.

### 1.2 No lookahead
- No feature/gate/score may depend on future candles (index > last closed).

### 1.3 Determinism
- Same inputs + same config => same outputs.
- No stochastic components.

### 1.4 Score ranges
- All component scores and final scores are clamped to `0..100`.

### 1.5 percent_rank population
- `percent_rank` population is the *eligible universe after hard gates* (not the shortlist).
- Tie handling is `average_rank` with:
  - `rank = (count_less + 0.5*count_equal) / N` in `[0..1]`.

## 3) Expected multipliers & component scores (Fixture A)

### 3.1 Overextension multiplier (d = 20.6625)
Expected:
- overextension_multiplier = 0.837578018
Explanation:
- 20 < d < 28 uses linear segment 0.85 -> 0.70.

### 3.2 Anti-chase multiplier (r7 = 33.0156)
Expected:
- anti_chase_multiplier = 0.974869956
Explanation:
- 30..60 linear 1.0 -> 0.75.

### 3.3 BB score (rank r = 0.595833333)
Expected:
- bb_score = 40.625000000
Explanation:
- 0.20..0.60 linear 100 -> 40.

### 3.4 Volume score (spike_combined = 2.425059108)
Expected:
- volume_score = 92.505910842
Explanation:
- 1.5..2.5 linear 0 -> 100.

### 3.5 Breakout distance score
This fixture asserts that the *input* `dist_pct` is correct and the curve parameters are:
- floor=-5, min=2, ideal=5, max=20
The numeric score must match the implemented curve exactly.

### 3.6 Gates for Fixture A (must pass)
- trend_gate_1d:
  - ema20_1d > ema50_1d => True
  - close_1d > ema20_1d => True
- atr_chaos_gate_1d:
  - atr_pct_rank_120_1d <= 0.80 => True
- overextension_hard_gate_1d:
  - dist_ema20_pct_1d < 28.0 => True
- momentum_gate_1d:
  - r_7_1d > 0 => True

## 4) Negative Fixture Set B — BTC Risk-Off without RS override => Excluded

Goal: When BTC is risk-off and RS override conditions are not met, setup must be invalid/excluded.

Arrange (synthetic):
- btc_risk_on = false
- quote_volume_24h_usd (alt) = 20,000,000  (passes risk-off liquidity)
- alt_r7_1d - btc_r7_1d = 7.49  (just below 7.5)
- alt_r3_1d - btc_r3_1d = 3.49  (just below 3.5)

Assert:
- RS override == false
- setup invalid (excluded from both immediate and retest lists)
- btc_multiplier must not be applied because candidate is excluded.

---

## 5) Negative Fixture Set C — Overextension hard gate boundary => Excluded

Arrange (synthetic):
- dist_ema20_pct_1d = 28.0

Assert:
- setup invalid (excluded) because hard gate is strict: `dist_ema20_pct_1d < 28.0`.

---

## 7) AI Review Checklist (questions to answer)
- Do the fixture inputs reproduce the expected derived values exactly?
- Are all hard gates applied exactly as specified (including strict inequalities)?
- Is `percent_rank` tie-handling implemented as average-rank?
- Is the population for percent_rank the eligible universe after hard gates (not shortlist)?
- Is the output ordering deterministic and stable (see liquidity re-rank rules)?
